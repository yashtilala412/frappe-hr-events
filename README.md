## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1.  **Create your Slack App**:
    -   Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app.
    -   Go to **"OAuth & Permissions"**.
    -   Add the following **Bot Token Scopes**:
        -   `chat:write` (to send messages)
        -   `users:read` (to find users)
        -   `users:read.email` (to find users by email)
    -   Install the app to your workspace and copy the **"Bot User OAuth Token"** (it starts with `xoxb-`).

2.  **Configure Frappe**:
    -   In your Frappe Desk, go to the **"HR Event Settings"** page.
    -   Paste your **Slack Bot Token** and **Save**.

3.  **Prepare Your Employee Data**:
    -   Go to the **"Employee List"**.
    -   For each employee you want to include:
        -   Make sure their **"Date of Birth"** and **"Date of Joining"** are correct.
        -   Make sure their **"User ID"** field is linked to their Frappe `User` (the user that has their company email).

4.  **Sync Users**:
    -   Go back to **"HR Event Settings"**.
    -   Click the **"Sync Slack Users"** button.
    -   This will run in the background. You can check the **"User Meta List"** to see if your employees' Slack IDs have been fetched.

5.  **You're Done!**
    -   The app will now run a check every day. If it finds an employee with a birthday or work anniversary, it will automatically send them a celebratory DM!
